# Real-Time Wallet Credit System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation transforms your Blorb marketplace from showing "dummy money" to real-time wallet credits for sellers when buyers make payments. The system maintains your existing payout approval workflow while providing immediate wallet updates.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real Payment Tracking
- **Before**: Revenue calculated from order totals (dummy amounts)
- **After**: Revenue calculated from actual payment splits received
- **New Field**: `actualPaymentReceived` in order documents
- **Real-time Updates**: Seller wallets credited immediately when buyers pay

### 2. Payment Split System
- **Platform Fee**: 15% automatically deducted
- **Seller Share**: 85% credited to seller wallet
- **Audit Trail**: Complete payment split tracking
- **Multi-seller Support**: Handles orders with multiple sellers

### 3. Enhanced Financial Dashboard
- **Real Money Display**: Shows actual amounts received vs order totals
- **Payment Breakdown**: Visual split between platform fee and seller share
- **Live Balance**: Real-time available balance updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing data for legacy orders
